# About

This template was developed by the team at [Counteractive Security](https://www.counteractive.net), to help all organizations get a good start on a concise, directive, specific, flexible, and free incident response plan.  Build a [plan you will actually use](https://www.counteractive.net/posts/an-ir-plan-you-will-use/) to respond effectively, minimize cost and impact, and get back to business as soon as possible.

# Instructions

## Download or fork this template
The layout is as follows:

  * `during.md`: the core of the plan, actions taken during an incident response.
  * `playbooks/`: a folder containing playbooks with investigation, remediation, and communication suggestions for specific incidents.  Create playbooks for any incidents that are highly likely or highly damaging for your organization.  `playbooks/index.md` contains the playbook section header content, and each playbook should follow the convention `playbooks/playbook-[THREAT].md`.
  * `roles/`: a folder containing descriptions of each role in the plan, along with duties and training notes.  `index.md` contains the roles section header content, and each role should follow the convention `playbooks/role-[ORDER]-[NAME].md`.
  * `after.md`: the guide to after-action review (_a.k.a._, hotwash, debrief, or post-mortem)---actions taken after an incident response.
  * `about.md`: a footer containing information about the plan/template as a whole.
  * `data.yaml`: a file containing values for the template strings throughout the plan (see below)

## Find and replace template strings that `{{LOOK_LIKE_THIS}}`

This is the [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) syntax, and has wide support in a variety of tools and languages.  The easiest way to replace these is to customize the `data.yaml` file with your organization's information and use a tool like the mustache cli to automatically find and replace all the relevant strings:

```bash
mustache data.yaml template.md > filled-template.md
```

The defaults are These should be discernable from context, but the [default `data.yaml` file](./data.yaml) is commented for additional clarity.

If you don't have the things referenced in the variables, consider fixing that.  **Especially** the critical information list (data you want to protect) and critical asset list (systems you want to protect).

## Customize
1. Review all the `TODO` prompts for likely areas to customize, if desired.  Delete them if no changes are required.
1. Add any roles or playbooks relevant to your organization. These can also be added over time.
1. Customize anything else!  Whatever you feel is most effective for your organization.

## Build
Run whichever portions you like through [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) to create your format of choice, or use the markdown files with [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), or countless other platforms.

### Response Plan Creation Example
Combine the template components:
```bash
cat during.md \
    ./playbooks/index.md ./playbooks/playbook-*.md \
    ./roles/index.md ./roles/role-*.md \
    about.md > plan-template.md
```

Fill the template:
```bash
mustache data.yaml plan-template.md > plan.md
```

Use pandoc to create the format of your choice:
```bash
pandoc --toc --toc-depth=3 --standalone -o plan.html plan.md
```

Or do it all in one go:
```bash
cat data.yaml \
    during.md \
    ./playbooks/index.md ./playbooks/playbook-*.md \
    ./roles/index.md ./roles/role-*.md \
    about.md \
    | mustache \
    | pandoc --toc --toc-depth=3 --standalone -o ./public/response-plan.html
```
