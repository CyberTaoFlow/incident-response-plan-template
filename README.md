# About

This template was developed by the team at [Counteractive Security](https://www.counteractive.net), to help all organizations get a good start on a concise, directive, specific, flexible, and free incident response plan.  Build a [plan you will actually use](https://www.counteractive.net/posts/an-ir-plan-you-will-use/) to respond effectively, minimize cost and impact, and get back to business as soon as possible.

# Instructions

## Download or fork this template
The layout is as follows:

  * `during.md`: the core of the plan, actions taken during an incident response.
  * `playbooks/`: a folder containing playbooks with investigation, remediation, and communication suggestions for specific incidents.  Create playbooks for any incidents that are highly likely or highly damaging for your organization.  `playbooks/index.md` contains the playbook section header content, and each playbook should follow the convention `playbooks/playbook-[THREAT].md`.
  * `roles/`: a folder containing descriptions of each role in the plan, along with duties and training notes.  `index.md` contains the roles section header content, and each role should follow the convention `playbooks/role-[ORDER]-[NAME].md`.
  * `after.md`: the guide to after-action review (_a.k.a._, hotwash, debrief, or post-mortem)---actions taken after an incident response.
  * `about.md`: a footer containing information about the plan/template as a whole.

## Find and replace template variables that `LOOK_LIKE_THIS`

If you don't have the things referenced in the variables, consider fixing that.  **Especially** the critical information list (data you want to protect) and critical asset list (systems you want to protect).

## Customize
1. Review all the `TODO` prompts for likely areas to customize, if desired.  Delete them if no changes are required.
1. Add any roles or playbooks relevant to your organization. These can also be added over time.
1. Customize anything else!  Whatever you feel is most effective for your organization.

## Build
Run whichever portions you like through [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) to create your format of choice, or use the markdown files with [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), or countless other platforms.

### Response Plan Example
```bash
cat during.md \
    ./playbooks/index.md ./playbooks/playbook-*.md \
    ./roles/index.md ./roles/role-*.md \
    about.md \
