# Roles

The following are the descriptions, duties, and training for each of the defined roles in an incident response.

`TODO: Customize roles, descriptions, duties, and training, if necessary.`

## Structure of Roles

* Command Team
  * [Incident Commander](#role-incident-commander-ic)
  * [Deputy Incident Commander](#role-deputy-incident-commander-deputy)
  * [Scribe](#role-scribe)
* Liaison Team
  * Internal [Liaison](#role-liaison)
  * External Liaison
* Operations Team
  * [Subject Matter Experts](#role-subject-matter-expert-sme) (SMEs) for Systems
  * SMEs for Teams/Business Units
  * SMEs for Executive Functions (_e.g._, Legal, HR, Finance)
During larger complex incidents, the role structure may be adjusted to account for the creation of sub-teams. Read about how we handle [complex incidents](/before/complex_incidents.md) for more information.

This is a **flexible structure**: every role will not be filled by a different person for every incident. For example, in a small incident the Deputy might act as the Scribe and Internal Liaison. The structure is flexible and scales based on the incident.
